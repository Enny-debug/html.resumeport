         <h2>how to become a web developer</h2>
         <li>A bachelor's degree in a related field is one of the ways that you can fast-track your journey to becoming a web programmer. If you do not have a degree and do not have the time or inclination to get one, there is another possibility.
            you can gain relevant qualifications from a trusted provider. This shows employers that you know the basics and (if you take an advanced course) are proficient at even the hardest aspects of being a website developer.</li>
